## Overview

This is an interactive **GUI-based password auditing tool** designed to analyse password strength, patterns, and vulnerabilities. It leverages various **visualisations and statistics**, and supports a broad range of **hashing algorithms**, including:

- MD5, SHA Family (SHA1, SHA256, SHA512), NTLM, LM  
- BLAKE2b, BLAKE2s, SHA3 Family  
- **ASCON** (lightweight cryptography finalist)

---

## Features

### Visual Analytics
The tool visualises multiple password strength metrics, such as:
- Password Quality Index  
- Password Length Distribution  
- Success Rate  
- Character Frequency  
- Zxcvbn Password Score

### ASCON Support
A key differentiator is support for the **ASCON** hashing algorithm â€” implemented using the official implementation (`ascon.py`). While fully functional, its performance is not on par with other algorithms, making it a key focus area in future improvements.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Pr0xy08/CSC3094-Password-Auditing-Tool.git
2. Navigate to project dir:
   ```bash
   cd CSC3094-Password-Auditing-Tool
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Run the application:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
---
## Usage Guide

1. Launch the app. You'll land on the **Run** page (`run.py`).
2. Select a hashing mode.  
   - *Wordlist mode (default)* is recommended for speed.
3. Choose a hash type.  
   - If unsure, tools like [Hash-Identifier](https://www.kali.org/tools/hash-identifier/) may help.
4. Set a timeout.  
   - This limits how long to audit each hash. E.g., `5s per hash` means 5 hashes = 25s max.
5. Upload a `.txt` file with target hashes.  
   - One hash per line, no other data.
6. If using Wordlist mode, upload a wordlist file.  
   - examples like `rockyou.txt` work well (used in the evaluation report).
7. Click **Run**, then wait for results and visual analytics to load.
